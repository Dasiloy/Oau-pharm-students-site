 for fulfillment, provided o n e w a s diligent a n d knowledgeable. It is a field that allows for a d e e p\
engagement with science and the opportunity to make a tangible impact on people\'s lives, which I found immensely appealing.\

    question:'With all your experiences sir,if you had the opportunity to do it all over, would you still choose Pharmacy? And would you choose Ife Pharmacy?',
    replierSource:'Pharm Adejuwon Otelaja',
    replies:' Without a doubt, I would choose Pharmacy again fi given the chance to do it all over. The profession has provided me with a\
     fulfilling career, a chance to make a real difference in people\'s lives, and opportunities to continually learn and grow.\
As for choosing Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), I would not hesitate to say that once an Ife pharmacist, always an Ife pharmacist.\
 My time at OAU was a transformative experience. The university provided me with morethan just an academic education; it taught me about\
  the vicissitudes of life, instilled in me resilience, and shaped my worldview.\
However, with the benefit of hindsight and the experiences I have gained, there are certainly some changes Iwould make.\
 As we navigate through life, we acquire knowledge and insights that we may not have had at the outset. But overall, the journey\
  I\'ve been on, both academically and professionally, is one that I treasure and would willingly embark on again.'
